In order to comply with \nTreasury Board policies and directives on contracts awarded to FPS, bidders must provide the information \nrequired below before contract award. If the answer to the questions and, as applicable the information \nrequired have not been received by the time the evaluation of bids is completed, Canada will inform the Bidder \nof a time frame within which to provide the information. Failure to comply with Canada’s request and meet the \nrequirement within the prescribed time frame will render the bid non-responsive. \n \nDefinitions \n \nFor the purposes of this clause, \"former public servant\" is any former member of a department as defined in \nthe Financial Administration Act, R.S., 1985, c. F-11, a former member of the Canadian Armed Forces or a \nformer member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

The lump sum payment period does not include the \nperiod of severance pay, which is measured in a like manner. \n \n\"pension\" means a pension or annual allowance paid under the Public Service Superannuation \nAct (PSSA), R.S., 1985, c. P-36, and any increases paid pursuant to the Supplementary Retirement Benefits \nAct, R.S., 1985, c. S-24 as it affects the PSSA. It does not include pensions payable pursuant to the Canadian \nForces Superannuation Act, R.S., 1985, c. C-17, the Defence Services Pension Continuation Act, 1970, c. D-\n3, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act , 1970, c. R-10, and the Royal Canadian \nMounted Police Superannuation Act, R.S., 1985, c. R-11, the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances \nAct, R.S. 1985, c. M-5, and that portion of pension payable to the Canada Pension Plan Act, R.S., 1985, c. C-\n8. \n \nFormer Public Servant in Receipt of a Pension \n \nAs per the above definitions, is the Bidder a FPS in receipt of a pension? Yes ☐  No ☐   \n \nIf so, the Bidder must provide the following information, for all FPSs in receipt of a pension, as applicable: \n \na) name of former public servant; \nb) date of termination of employment or retirement from the Public Service.  \n \nBy providing this information, Bidders agree that the successful Bidder’s status, with respect to being a former \npublic servant in receipt of a pension, will be reported on departmental websites as part of the published \nproactive disclosure reports in accordance with Contracting Policy Notice: 2019-01 and the Guidelines on the \nProactive Disclosure of Contracts. \n \nWork Force Adjustment Directive \n \nIs the Bidder a FPS who received a lump sum payment pursuant to the terms of the Work Force Adjustment \nDirective? Yes ☐  No ☐   \n \nIf so, the Bidder must provide the following information: \na) name of former public servant; \nb) conditions of the lump sum payment incentive; \nc) date of termination of employment; \nd) amount of lump sum payment; \ne) rate of pay on which lump sum payment is based; \nf) period of lump sum payment including start date, end date and number of weeks;  \ng) number and amount (professional fees) of other contracts subject to the restrictions of a work force \nadjustment program. \n2.4 Enquiries - Bid Solicitation \nAll enquiries must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Authority no later than five (5) calendar days \nbefore the bid closing date. Enquiries received after that time may not be answered. \n \nBidders should reference as accurately as possible the numbered item of the bid solicitation to which the \nenquiry relates. Care should be taken by Bidders to explain each question in sufficient detail in order to enable \nCanada to provide an accurate answer. Technical enquiries that are of a proprietary nature must be clearly \nmarked \"proprietary\" at each relevant item. Items identified as “proprietary” will be treated as such except \nwhere Canada determines that the enquiry is not of a proprietary nature. Can ada may edit the question(s) or \nmay request that the Bidder do so, so that the proprietary nature of the question(s) is eliminated and the \nenquiry can be answered to all Bidders. Enquiries not submitted in a form that can be distributed to all Bidders \nmay not be answered by Canada. \n\n \n \n \n RFP # NRCan-5000088835  \n \n \n \n2.5 Applicable Laws \nAny resulting contract must be interpreted and governed, and the relations between the parties determined, by \nthe laws in force in Ontario. \n \nBidders may, at their discretion, substitute the applicable laws of a Canadian province or territory of their \nchoice without affecting the validity of their bid, by deleting the name of the Canadian province or territory \nspecified and inserting the name of the Canadian province or territory of their choice. If no change is made, it \nacknowledges that the applicable laws specified are acceptable to the Bidders. \n \n2.6 Improvement of Requirement During Solicitation Period \nShould bidders consider that the specifications or Statement of Work contained in the bid solicitation could be \nimproved technically or technologically, bidders are invited to make suggestions, in writing, to the Contracting \nAuthority named in the bid solicitation. Bidders must clearly outline the suggested improvement as well as the \nreason for the suggestion. Suggestions that do not restrict the level of competition nor favour a particular \nbidder will be given consideration provided they are submitted to the Contracting Authority at least ten (10) \ncalendar days before the bid closing date. Canada will have the right to accept or reject any or all suggestions.  \n \n2.7 Basis for Canada's Ownership of Intellectual Property \nNatural Resources Canada has determined that any intellectual property rights arising from the performance of \nthe Work under the resulting contract will belong to Canada, on the following reasons:  as set out in the Policy \non Title to Intellectual Property Arising Under Crown Procurement Contracts   \n \n1. Where the main purpose of the Crown Procurement Contract, or the deliverables contracted for, is: \no 4.3 To deliver a not-yet fully developed component or subsystem that will be incorporated into a \ncomplete system at a later date, as a prerequisite to the planned transfer of the complete \nsystem to the private sector, through licensing or assignment of ownership, for the purposes of \nCommercial Exploitation. \n2.8 Bid Challenge and Recourse Mechanisms \n \n(a) Several mechanisms are available to potential suppliers to challenge aspects of the procurement process \nup to and including contract award.  \n \n(b) Canada encourages suppliers to first bring their concerns to the attention of the Contracting Authority.  \nCanada’s Buy and Sell  website, under the heading “ Bid Challenge and Recourse Mechanisms ” contains \ninformation on potential complaint bodies such as: \n \n• Office of the Procurement Ombudsman (OPO) \n• Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT) \n \n(c) Suppliers should note that there are strict deadlines  for filing complaints, and the time periods vary \ndepending on the complaint body in question. Suppliers should therefore act quickly when they want to \nchallenge any aspect of the procurement process.  \n \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n RFP # NRCan-5000088835  \n \n \n \nPART 3 - BID PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS \n3.1 Bid Preparation Instructions \nThe Bidder must submit its bid electronically, Canada requests that the Bidder submits its bid in accordance \nwith section 08 of the 2003 standard instructions. The CPC Connect system has a limit of 1GB per single \nmessage posted and a limit of 20GB per conversation. \n \n Canada requests that the Bidder submits its bid in separately saved documents as follows: \n \nSection I:  Technical Bid \nSection II:  Financial Bid \nSection III:  Certifications \nSection IV:  Page one completed and signed. \n \nIf the Bidder is simultaneously providing copies of its bid using multiple acceptable delivery methods, and if \nthere is a discrepancy between the wording of any of these copies and the electronic copy provided through \nCPC Connect service, the wording of the electronic copy provided through CPC Connect service will have \npriority over the wording of the other copies. \n \nPrices must appear in the financial bid only.  No prices must be indicated in any other section of the \nbid. \nIn April 2006, Canada issued a policy directing federal departments and agencies to take the necessary steps \nto incorporate environmental considerations into the procurement process Policy on Green Procurement \n(https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32573). To assist Canada in reaching its objectives, bidders \nshould: \n \n1) Include all environmental certification(s) relevant to your organization (e.g., ISO 14001, Leadership \nin Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Carbon Disclosure Project, etc.)  \n2) Include all environmental certification(s) or Environmental Product Declaration(s) (EPD) specific to \nyour product/service (e.g., Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), ENERGYSTAR, etc.)  \n \nSection I: Technical Bid \n \nIn their technical bid, Bidders should demonstrate their understanding of the requirements contained in the bid \nsolicitation and explain how they will meet these requirements. Bidders should demonstrate their capability and \ndescribe their approach in a thorough, concise and clear manner for carrying out the work. \n \nThe technical bid should address clearly and in sufficient depth the points that are subject to the evaluation \ncriteria against which the bid will be evaluated. Simply repeating the statement contained in the bid solicitation \nis not sufficient. In order to facilitate the evaluation of the bid, Canada requests that Bidders address and \npresent topics in the order of the evaluation criteria under the same headings. To avoid duplication, Bidders \nmay refer to different sections of their bids by identifying the specific paragraph and page number where the \nsubject topic has already been addressed. \n \nSection II: Financial Bid \n3.1.1 Bidders must submit their financial bid in accordance with the Financial Bid Presentation Sheet in \nAppendix \"B\".  \n \n3.1.2 Exchange Rate Fluctuation \n \nC3011T (2013-11-06), Exchange Rate Fluctuation  \n \nSection III: Certifications \nBidders must submit the certifications and additional information required under Part 5.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n RFP # NRCan-5000088835  \n \n \n \n \nPART 4 - EVALUATION PROCEDURES AND BASIS OF SELECTION \n4.1 Evaluation Procedures \n(a) Bids will be assessed in accordance with the entire requirement of the bid solicitation including the \ntechnical evaluation criteria. \n \n(b) An evaluation team composed of representatives of Canada will evaluate the bids.  \n \n4.1.1 Technical Evaluation \n \nMandatory and point rated technical evaluation criteria are included in Appendix “A” – Evaluation Criteria. \n4.2 Basis of Selection \n4.2.1 Highest Combined Rating of Technical Merit (70%) and Price (30%)    \nTo be declared responsive, a bid must:  \na. comply with all the requirements of the bid solicitation; and  \nb. meet all mandatory criteria. \n2. Bids not meeting (a) or (b) will be declared non-responsive.  \n3. The selection will be based on the highest responsive combined rating of technical merit and price. The \nratio will be 70% for the technical merit and 30% for the price.  \n4. To establish the technical merit score, the overall technical score for each responsive bid will be \ndetermined as follows: total number of points obtained / maximum number of points available multiplied by \nthe ratio of 70%.  \n5. To establish the pricing score, each responsive bid will be prorated against the lowest evaluated price and \nthe ratio of 30%.  \n6. For each responsive bid, the technical merit score and the pricing score will be added to determine its \ncombined rating.  \n7. Neither the responsive bid obtaining the highest technical score nor the one with the lowest evaluated \nprice will necessarily be accepted. The responsive bid with the highest combined rating of technical merit \nand price will be recommended for award of a contract.  \nThe table below illustrates an example where all three bids are responsive and the selection of the contractor \nis determined by a 70/30 ratio of technical merit and price, respectively. The total available points equal 135 \nand the lowest evaluated price is $45,000 (45). \n \nBasis of Selection - Highest Combined Rating Technical Merit (70%) and Price (30%)  \n Bidder 1 Bidder 2 Bidder 3 \nOverall Technical Score  115/135 89/135 92/135 \nBid Evaluated Price  $55,000.00 $50,000.00 $45,000.00 \nCalculations  \nTechnical \nMerit Score  115/135 x 70 = 59.63 89/135 x 70 = 46.15 92/135 x 70 = 47.70 \nPricing \nScore  45/55 x 30 = 24.55 45/50 x 30 = 27 45/45 x 30 = 30 \nCombined Rating  84.18 73.15 77.70 \nOverall Rating  1st 3rd 2nd \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n RFP # NRCan-5000088835  \n \n \n \nPART 5 – CERTIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION \n \nBidders must provide the required certifications and additional information to be awarded a contract.  \n \nThe certifications provided by Bidders to Canada are subject to verification by Canada at all times.

Carbon capture, utilization and \nstorage (CCUS) is a promising climate-measure that will play a significant role in achieving net-zero by 2050. \nAccording to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Net Zero Emissions roadmap, c arbon capture, utilization \nand storage accounts for 6.1 GtCO2/year in global emissions reductions by 2050.  \n \nA CCUS process is a process that includes the capture of CO2 either directly from the ambient air or from \nanthropogenic streams that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, as well as the storage or use of \nthe captured carbon. \n \nIn December 2023, Finance Canada tabled Bill C-59 in Parliament, which includes amendments to the Income \nTax Act to implement the Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage Investment Tax Credit (CCUS -ITC). Now \nthat the Bill has received Royal Assent, CCUS-ITC will be retroactively available from January 1, 2022 for \nqualified geological sequestration projects as well as for storage of CO2 in concrete. \n \nRecently, storage of CO2 in mine tailings via mineralization has been identified as a potential storage pathway. \nCurrently, this is not designated as an eligible use under the CCUS-ITC. The Government of Canada \nrecognizes that the development and deployment of novel CCUS technologies will be critical for Canada to \nmeet its stated GHG emissions reduction targets. However, the federal government requires a complete \nunderstanding of the potential of this new storage technique for long term storage and environm ental impacts. \n \nSW.3.0  OBJECTIVES \n \nNRCan is seeking a Service Provider to complete a research report that provides an overview and analysis \nof the potential of mineralized mine tailings for CO2 storage. The report should be limited in scope to the \nenvironmental and industrial contexts of Canada but should consider mineralization technologies and \npractices in use globally. All information provided from external sources should be supported by valid \nreferences in APA format. Major assumptions and simplifications made in the analysis should be identified \nand justified.  \n \nThe report should address the following key objectives: \n \n1. Assess the permanence of CO2 sequestration of all major sources of viable mine tailings in \nCanada.  \na. Identify the Canadian mining operations that produce relevant mine tailings and could be \npotential users of CO2 mineralization. Quantify the approximate amount of the relevant \nmine tailings produced. \nb. Identify the affect of mine tailing composition on the performance of mine tailings as a CO 2 \nstorage reservoir and describe the key mechanisms that impact tailings mineralization \nviability. These may include mineralization efficiency, reactivity, or porosity. Indicate CO2 \nuptake on a mass basis for the various types of mine tailings.  \nc. Estimate the length of time it is reasonable to expect for CO2 to remain sequestered in \nmineralized mine tailings under ideal conditions. Identify the necessary conditions and the \nmanagement practices required to achieve this estimate. \nd. Describe major factors and mechanisms by which the sequestration timeline could be \nnegatively affected and indicate the relative risk potential for each.  \n2. Characterize contemporary mineralization technologies used for CO2 sequestration in mine tailings \nand industrial waste materials.  \na. Create block flow diagrams for each mineralization technology indicating the process steps \n\n \n \n \n RFP # NRCan-5000088835  \n \n \n \nand material or energy inputs and outputs. If the processes include extraction steps for \nother valuable minerals contained in the tailings, include these steps within the analysis.  \nAssess each technology in its ideal context, i.e. do not interchange CO2 supply or mineral \ntype between mineralization technologies. \nb. Specify rates of reaction (i.e. rate of mineralization) for each of the mineralization processes \nidentified. \nc. Distinguish the technologies by the source of CO2 (e.g. flue gas, pipeline quality, \natmospheric) and the type of mineralization process (e.g., ex-situ mineralization, mine \ntailings vs. industrial waste, enhanced weathering, etc.). Identify the key factors and \ncontrolling mechanisms that can affect the performance of CO2 mineralization processes \nincluding, but not limited to, temperature, pressure, pH, and particle size. Report ideal \noperating ranges for each parameter. \nd. Identify companies and commercial technologies worldwide that are already utilizing this \ntechnology or have identified the potential for it in their operations.  \ne. Identify and assess the necessity for pre-treatment of either tailings/waste materials or CO2 \nstreams for sequestration processes.  \nf. Identify and assess the peripheral or ancillary equipment required for CO 2 mineralization of \nmine tailings and industrial waste products.  \n3. Conduct a consequential, gate-to-grave lifecycle assessment of the predominant mineralization \ntechnology with the highest use potential for the Canadian context. Use the functional unit of 1 ton \nCO2 sequestered permanently. Use the ReCiPe 2016 method for midpoint and endpoint indicators.  \na. Create a preliminary process model, including a simplified Process Flow Diagram and \nenergy and material balance, for the mineralization facility. Assume the availability of CO 2 \nat the requisite input conditions for the process.  \nb. Report the energy demand of CO2 sequestration in mine tailings.  \nc. Provide a general discussion for the non-greenhouse gas-related environmental and health \nimpacts of CO2 sequestration in tailings ponds. This includes a discussion of the reactions \noccurring within the ponds and their effects on pH (acid or base generation), environmental \nconsequences of tailings mineralization, hydrogeological impacts, and the production of \nchemicals toxic to wildlife/vegetation. \nd. Discuss the impact of CO2 mineralization on the reclamation of tailing storage facilities. \n4. Identify and assess project costs (Capital Expense, Operating Expense, and levelized cost per \ntonne of CO2 stored) for a CO2 mineralization project using the predominant tailings mineralization \ntechnology installed in an average and suitable Canadian mine. Include all peripheral and pre-\ntreatment equipment required. Assume a suitable source of CO2 is co-located with the mine. \nDisaggregate costs by process stage (e.g., tailings transportation, pre-treatment, mineralization, \ndisposal). \n5. Conduct a review of the regulatory framework of Canada’s federal and provincial/territorial \njurisdictions, including an analysis of measurement, monitoring, and verification (MMV) approaches.  \na. Identify current MMV practices used in CO2 mineralization projects, knowledge gaps, and \nopportunities for improving the regulatory feasibility of storage in mine tailings.  \nb. Analyze the current regulations in place for CO2 mineralization in mine tailings, both in \nrelevant Canadian jurisdictions and abroad, and identify the gaps that need to be \naddressed in Canada to develop an enabling regulatory framework. \n \nSW.4.0  PROJECT REQUIREMENTS \n \nSW.4.1 Tasks, Deliverables, Milestones and Schedule \n \nThe Project Authority will work to ensure that the contract is on budget and of an acceptable quality through \nworking in close consultation with the Service Provider and through regular (monthly) status updates , \nrequirements, and opportunities to review and comment on work as it is progressing.

For the purposes of this project, only alkaline wastes / by -\nproducts with the capacity to react with CO2 to produce carbonates should be \nconsidered.  \nMine Tailings \nManagement \nAn industrial practice involving the confinement of mine tailings to provide safe, long -\nterm disposal. More information can be found at this link: Tailings Management at \nNRCan (canada.ca). \nLifecycle \nAssessment \nA standardized process by which the environmental impacts of a product or service are \ncalculated in terms of a functional unit. The standard practice for Lifecycle Assessment \ncan be found in ISO 14040:2006. \nGate to Grave A Lifecycle Assessment term that indicates the boundaries of the assessment. “Gate” \nindicates that the starting boundary of the product system does not begin at the “cradle” \nfor all product flows. “Grave” indicates that all product flows produced by the good or \nservice must terminate at their final location. For the purposes of this project, the “Gate” \nfor mine tailings is after their production at the mine site. For CO2, the “Gate” may be at \nthe point in which it is transported to the mineralization facility, or the point at which it is \ncaptured.  \n \n\n \n \n \n RFP # NRCan-5000088835  \n \n \n \nANNEX “B” BASIS OF PAYMENT \n \n(To be completed at contract award) \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n RFP # NRCan-5000088835  \n \n \n \nAPPENDIX “A” - EVALUATION CRITERIA \n \n \nMandatory Technical Criteria \nBidders are advised to address these criteria in the following order and in sufficient depth in their proposals to \nenable a thorough assessment.
